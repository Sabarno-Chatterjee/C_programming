* int main() function
An int is a keyword that references an integer data type. An int data type used with the main() function that indicates the function should return an integer value. When we use an int main() function, it is compulsory to write return 0; statement at the end of the main() function.

Eg:

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}


Syntax:

\t (Horizontal tab) – We use it to shift the cursor to a couple of spaces to the right in the same line.

\n is an escape sequence that denotes a newline character.


* VARIABLES

Creating a variable takes two steps:

(a) Declaration :

type variableName = value; Where type is one of C types (such as int ), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable.

eg: 

int year;

(b) Initialisation: 


Variables are explicitly initialized if they are assigned a value in the declaration statement.


eg:

year = 2023

or it can be merged into one step;

int year = 2023;
